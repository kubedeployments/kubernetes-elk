# ELK in Kubernetes

These are some Kubernetes manifests to help you stand up an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (with Grafana too)) inside your Kubernetes cluster.

More documentation coming soon...

## Usage
Apply all the things - `kubectl apply -f ./` 

## Services
Append the following to your cluster endpoint to access each part 
* `/elk/elasticsearch` - Kibana data node (port 9200) endpoint 
* `/elk/kibana` - Kibana web UI
* `/elk/grafana` - Grafana web UI

example (assuming your using [KIAB](https://github.com/nickmaccarthy/kube-in-a-box) ), you can access Kibana at `http://kiab.local/elk/kibana` in your web browser on your local machine.  

## Requirements 
* Kubernetes (obsiously) - check out [KIAB](https://github.com/nickmaccarthy/kube-in-a-box) to get a cluster up and running quickly
* Needs an ingress controller such as [Traefik](http://traefik.io) (built into KIAB)
